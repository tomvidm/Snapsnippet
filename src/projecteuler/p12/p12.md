# Problem 12 - Highly divisible triangular number
# Description

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

     1: 1
     3: 1,3
     6: 1,2,3,6
    10: 1,2,5,10
    15: 1,3,5,15
    21: 1,3,7,21
    28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Notes
### Brute force method
Trial by division. For every integer n, check all numbers `k < n` for which `n (mod k) == 0`.

### Euler Totient
The euler totient function `phi(n)` counts the number of integers `k < n` for which `gcd(k, n) == 1` - in other words, all the integers that are coprime to n. Conversely, `n - phi(n)` counts the number of divisors (With repetition) the integer has.

However, the goal is to find the first `tri(n)` for which the number of distict divisors (including 1 and n) is over 500. The euler totient function can be used to find an upper estimate by using the following inequality:

```
tri(n) - phi(tri(n)) > 500
```

By using `tri(n) = n(n + 1)/2`, the computation can be simplified because of the multiplicative property of the euler totient function. The terms in the triangular function are coprime. (Proof?)

For odd numbers: `phi(tri(n)) = phi(n) phi((n + 1)/2)`

For even numbers: `phi(tri(n)) = phi(n + 1) phi(n/2)`
